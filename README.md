	Coeffecient
Avg. Session Length	25.981550

Time on App	38.590159

Time on Website	0.190405

Length of Membership	61.279097



This is tricky, there are two ways to think about this: Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that is what is working better. This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, you would probably want to explore the relationship between Length of Membership and the App or the Website before coming to a conclusion!
